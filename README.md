# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of mini projects I started after learning Python in the last year. Some were based off of my interests at the time while others were created on a whim out of curiosity.

A few projects were created before I learned about git/GitHub and how to use it, so they were not well documented from the start. I am revisiting some scripts to update and try to improve them, if necessary. As of March 28, 2022, the version of Python being used is 3.9.12. 

## Projects

1) **Shopping Cart**
   * *Features:* mimics adding items to a shopping cart and checking out
   * *Inspiration:* At the time I was into blind box collectible toys that contain one of 12 variants, with a chance to get the "secret" that had much lower odds of obtaining
2) **Vending Machine**
   * *Features:* mimics choosing an item from a vending machine, dispensing said item, and opening the item (if desired)
   * *Inspiration:* Similar to the shopping cart, I created this script to simulate buying a blind box out of a vending machine and opening the box on the spot to see what variant was inside
