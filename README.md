# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of mini projects I started after learning Python in the last year. Some were based off of my interests at the time while others were created on a whim out of curiosity. Most projects are simple text-based scripts that run directly in terminal.

A few projects were created before I learned about git/GitHub and how to use it, so they were not well documented from the start. I am revisiting some scripts to update and try to improve them as I see fit. As of March 28, 2022, the version of Python being used is 3.9.12. 

## Projects

1) **Shopping Cart**
   * *Features:* mimics adding items to a shopping cart and checking out
   * *Inspiration:* At the time I was into blind box collectible toys that contain one of 12 variants, with a chance to get the "secret" that had much lower odds of obtaining
2) **Vending Machine**
   * *Features:* mimics choosing an item from a vending machine, dispensing said item, and opening the item (if desired)
   * *Inspiration:* Similar to the shopping cart, I created this script to simulate buying a blind box out of a vending machine and opening the box on the spot to see what variant was inside
3) **Discord Bot**
   * *Features:* sends an embedded message to the designated Discord channel every 10 minutes
   * *Inspiration:* I wanted to create a bot that could send a frequent reminder about things like "hydrate" or "sit straight" to my Discord channel because I often send my friends gifs of those for fun. I was able to get started and learn a lot from the tutorial on [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/)
